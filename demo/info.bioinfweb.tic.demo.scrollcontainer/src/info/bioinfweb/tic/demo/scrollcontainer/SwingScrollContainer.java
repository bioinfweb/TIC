/**
 * The toolkit-specific <i>Swing</i> implementation for the scroll container of this demo.
 * <p>
 * This class inherits from {@link JScrollPane} and sets the <i>Swing</i> component created
 * from {@link OutputComponent} as its viewport view to be scrolled. 
 * <p>
 * A number of method implementations are inherited from {@link ScrollPaneSwingToolkitComponent}, which 
 * provides respective default methods. This class only needs to provide references to its 
 * instances by implementing {@link #getSwingComponent()} and {@link #getScrollPane()}.
