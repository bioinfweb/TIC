/**
 * Scrollable <i>Swing</i> components (implementing {@link ScrollingToolkitComponent}) can implement this
 * interface, if they provide scrolling functionality using a {@link JScrollPane}. It contains
 * default method implementations that delegate the scrolling methods of {@link ScrollingToolkitComponent}
 * to {@link JScrollPane}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is not meant and does not tag a class to provide any functionality in addition
 * to {@link ScrollingToolkitComponent}. <i>Swing</i> components that provide scrolling functionality 
 * directly instead of relying in {@link JScrollPane} should implement 
 * {@link ScrollingToolkitComponent} directly and implement its methods respectively.
