/**
 * Interface to be implemented by all toolkit-specific GUI components associated with a {@link TICComponent}.
 * <p>
 * Note that implementing classes must always provide constructors that match the parameters expected by the
 * associated {@link TICComponent}. Additional parameters are specified by 
 * {@link TICComponent#getSwingComponentConstructorParameters(Object...)} or
 * {@link TICComponent#getSWTComponentConstructorParameters(Object...)}. All constructors must have the 
 * following set of parameters, possible followed by additional parameters defined by the <i>TIC</i> component: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Swing: {@code SomeSwingComponent(TICComponent owner)}</li> 
 *   <li>SWT: {@code SomeSWTComponent(TICComponent owner, Composite parent, int style)}</li>
 * </ul>
