/**
 * This is the parent class of all GUI components based in TIC. Inherited classes are toolkit independent GUI 
 * components that can be used in both Swing and SWT GUIs. To create toolkit specific instances of inherited
 * classes {@code SwingComponentFactory} and {@code SWTComponentFactory} from the according TIC modules can be used.
 * <p>
 * To create a concrete TIC component, the abstract methods {@link #paint(TICPaintEvent)} and {@link #getSize()} 
 * need to be implemented. Implementing these methods is sufficient for creating components that paint their
 * contents directly. If toolkit specific versions containing subcomponents from Swing or SWT are created instead,
 * {@link #getSwingComponentClassName()} and {@link #getSWTComponentClassName()} must be overwritten accordingly
 * and the implementation of {@link #paint(TICPaintEvent)} may remain empty.  
 * <p>
 * Note that depending on your GUI design {@link #assignSize()} might not have the desired effect if 
 * {@link #assignSizeToSWTLayoutData(org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Point, Composite)} is not overwritten with an according 
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * <b>Mouse and keyboard events</b>
 * <p>
 * TIC components support adding TIC event listeners for mouse and keyboard events. Due to the implementation of this 
 * behavior the toolkit specific components always have mouse and key listeners attached, no matter if a TIC listener 
 * was attached to the owning TIC component. In the case of Swing components events will not be forwarded to parent
 * components anymore, even if no listener in this component consumed the event. Therefore TIC components automatically
 * forward events to parent Swing components, if no TIC listener for the according event type consumed that event.
 * TIC listener indicate whether they consumed an event by the return value of their handler methods (e.g. 
 * {@link TICMouseWheelListener#mouseWheelMoved(info.bioinfweb.tic.input.TICMouseWheelEvent)}).
 * <p>
 * If more than one listener for the same event type is attached to a TIC component, all listeners will be informed
 * on events, no matter if a previous listener in the list already consumed the event. (Only forwarding to parent events
 * is influenced by the return value of TIC event listeners.)
